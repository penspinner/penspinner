### GREETINGS!

I'm a software engineer in NYC. My focus is on frontend engineering, but I've recently been doing more LeetCode and system design to round out my knowledge. I also have interest in game development. However, I'm unsure of where to start. Any tips would be appreciated.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out to me through email.

**I'm currently available for hire!**
